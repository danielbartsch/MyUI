1. Open a terminal inside this folder
2. run `./.backup` to backup your existing settings
3. run `./.install` to copy settings to their places
4. go to `dwm` and run `sudo make install` to compile `dwm`
5. go to `dmenu` and run `sudo make install` to compile `dmenu`
6. log out and in again (or reboot)
7. profit, hopefully (if something doesn't work, get rid of `~/.profile`, and restore your old `~/.profile` by renaming `~/.profile.bak` to `~/.profile`)
